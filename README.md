# JavaScript Generators
### Summary
JavaScript generators look synchronous but are actually asynchronous, because any number of things can happen between calling `next()` on a generator instance.  They can be used to make API calls and to resolve promises.

### Dependencies

Running the examples will require `npm install node-fetch` and `npm install co`
